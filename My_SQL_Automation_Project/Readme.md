# Automated Data Cleaning Project on US Household Income

## Introduction

📊  This project focuses on automating data cleaning processes, aiming to enhance the accuracy and reliability of data analytics.

## Background

This project leverages SQL to automate the cleaning of US household income data, preparing it for insightful analysis and decision-making.

Data originates from a comprehensive dataset detailing household incomes across the United States, enriched with geographical and demographic details.

Through this project, we sought to answer:
- How can we automate data cleaning for efficiency and accuracy?
- What strategies ensure the preservation of raw data while maintaining a clean dataset for analysis?
- How can automated processes facilitate data integrity and standardization?

## Tools I Used

This project is built on the foundation of several essential tools:

- **MySQL:** The backbone of our data cleaning, enabling sophisticated querying and automation capabilities.

## The Analysis

This project employs MySQL stored procedures and events to automate the data cleaning process. Here’s a glimpse into the methodology:

1. **Automated Data Copying and Cleaning**
   - A stored procedure (`Copy_and_Clean_Data`) duplicates the original dataset, preserving raw data and creating a new cleaned version for analysis.
   - This procedure also includes steps to standardize text fields, correct common data errors, and remove duplicate records.

2. **Event Scheduling for Regular Data Cleaning**
   - A MySQL event (`run_data_cleaning`) is scheduled to automatically invoke the data cleaning procedure, ensuring the dataset remains current and clean.

## Instructions

1. **Event Scheduler Activation:**
   Ensure the MySQL Event Scheduler is enabled to allow automatic execution of the cleaning process. You can enable the scheduler by running:
   ```sql
   SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
   
## Deployment

- Clone the repository to obtain the SQL scripts.
- Use MySQL Workbench or a similar tool to execute the script, creating the necessary procedures, events, and triggers in your database.

## Execution

Initially, manually invoke the `Copy_and_Clean_Data` procedure to populate the cleaned dataset:

```sql
CALL Copy_and_Clean_Data();

- The event and trigger will automatically handle subsequent data cleaning.

##  What I Learned

   - 🔄 Automation with MySQL: Developed proficiency in automating data cleaning tasks using stored procedures, triggers, and events.
  -  🔒 Data Integrity Maintenance: Gained insights into maintaining a pristine dataset while preserving the original data for auditability.
   - 🧹 Clean Data Best Practices: Learned the importance of consistent data cleaning practices for reliable analysis and decision-making.

## Conclusions

-This project underscores the significance of automated data cleaning in enhancing data quality and reliability. By leveraging MySQL's advanced features, we've established a robust framework for maintaining clean and accurate datasets, facilitating more informed economic analyses and decisions.
