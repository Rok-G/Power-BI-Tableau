# SQL Projects Collection

Welcome to my collection of SQL projects. This repository serves as a portfolio of the various analytical challenges I've tackled using SQL. Each subdirectory in this repository is a standalone SQL project, complete with its own set of files and resources.

## Repository Structure

Within each project folder, you'll find everything that pertains to that specific SQL project:

- SQL scripts and queries
- `README.md` file explaining the project's context, objectives, and findings
- Any additional resources used or created during the project, such as CSV files, additional scripts, or images of output results

## Exploring the Projects

Feel free to dive into each project folder to explore the problems I've solved and the insights I've gleaned from data using SQL. If you're curious about a particular project's methodology or results, the `README.md` file in each project's folder will guide you through:

- The project's background and the data it analyzes
- The specific questions and hypotheses addressed
- The approach taken, including any data cleaning, preparation, and the SQL queries executed
- The conclusions drawn from the analysis

## Using These Projects

Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, a recruiter looking to understand my SQL proficiency, or someone interested in the intersection of data analysis and SQL, these projects are open for you to explore. 

If you'd like to use the SQL scripts or methodologies as a foundation for your own projects or analysis, feel free to do so in accordance with the licensing terms provided.

## Feedback and Contributions

If you have suggestions on how to improve these projects or if you've found an interesting way to extend the analysis, please don't hesitate to reach out or contribute.

Thank you for exploring my SQL projects.
