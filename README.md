# World Life Expectancy Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on exploring, cleaning, and analyzing the World Life Expectancy dataset. Our goal is to uncover insights into global health trends, specifically looking at factors like life expectancy, GDP, adult mortality, and BMI across different countries and years.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Identification and removal of duplicate records, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analysis of trends in life expectancy, relationships between GDP and health metrics, and other statistical analyses.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of key findings and trends.

## Technologies Used

- MySQL for database management and query execution.
- Python for data manipulation and visualization (if applicable).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have MySQL installed and set up.
3. Run the SQL scripts provided to create and populate the database.
4. Execute the analysis queries to explore the dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The World Life Expectancy dataset contains various health metrics for countries around the world across multiple years. Key columns include:

- `Country`
- `Year`
- `Life Expectancy`
- `Adult Mortality`
- `BMI`
- `GDP`

## Data Cleaning Process

Here's a brief overview of the data cleaning steps we've undertaken:

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Life Expectancy Trends

We analyzed life expectancy changes over 15 years, identifying significant increases in some countries.

### GDP and Life Expectancy

Our analysis shows a correlation between higher GDP and higher life expectancy.

### BMI and Life Expectancy

Investigating the relationship between BMI and life expectancy revealed interesting patterns.

## Insights and Conclusions

- Significant improvements in life expectancy have been observed in countries with rising GDP.
- A higher BMI does not necessarily correlate with a lower life expectancy, indicating the complexity of health determinants.
- Adult mortality rates show a declining trend in many regions, suggesting improvements in healthcare and living conditions.
